        <p>"Mi Guagua" it's the name of the diaper store of my aunts, and even they don't talk in english this can be
            translated later, but right now for the project I will use it in english. Also the logo they use right now
            it's that women with her baby. </p>
        <p>The site provides information about the products, payment methods, locations information abot the business
            and how it started, that are available at the
            moment, wanting to achieve a webpage with more functions in the future</p>
        <p>What else can I find in Mi Guagua Diaper Store?</p>
        <p>How can I contact with the owners of the Diaper Store?</p>
